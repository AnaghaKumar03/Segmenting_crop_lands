# Segmenting Crop Lands

## Overview
This project focuses on Precision Agriculture using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to segment crop lands for efficient weed management. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, we aim to help farmers identify and manage weeds more effectively, leading to improved crop yields and reduced herbicide usage.

## Features
- UAV image processing for crop field analysis
- Machine learning-based segmentation of crop lands
- Weed detection and classification
- Visualization tools for analysis results

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Project Structure
- `mv-project (2).ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation
- Other project files and resources

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/Segmenting_crop_lands.git
   cd Segmenting_crop_lands
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "mv-project (2).ipynb"
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook for:
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model training
   - Segmentation analysis
   - Results visualization
